# Codex Romaniser

A ruby script that will convert any number, up to 1 million, into a Roman Numeral. Please note that 1000 is represented by 'M', even in numbers above 10 000. Some online sources will represent 'M' as '-I', in accordance with the '-X' convention for the number 10 000. I think this is wrong.

RSpec tests for numbers up to 1000 also included.

Please note that this repository is part of the "Codex Z" series, which prioritises complexity and elegance of code over human readability. This is not to say that I consider these things mutually exclusive, but life is short and I have other fish to fry.
